        Zillah is a zealous young lady,currently pursuing a diploma course in  Software development at AkiraChix. She is enthusiastic about inspiring others to achieve and do good. She is as well highly attuned to the emotions,needs and motivation of others.She believes that everyone needs an ear when at their lowest.<br><br>

        She takes a great deal of pride and joy in bringing change to her community by engaging in community work and serving wherever she could. She has advocated for the importance of girl child education in her community and as well mentored them about their rights in efforts to curb teenage pregnancy. This has won her trips to several countries across Africa.<br><br>

        More than anything,Zillah is guided by her values;Spirituality,open-mindedness and self respect,which she wouldn't compromise for anything. She is a firm believer that everything happens with and for a reason. She is approachable,passionate about learning new ideas and ready to face correction  because her life revolves a lot  around growth, taking each day at a time. She values her reputation and therefore wouldnâ€™t engage in anything that soils it.<br><br>

       Scrabble works as therapy to her and she wouldn't mind having it any day at any time to jog her mind. Do not get shocked when you see her talking to herself and making faces;you just found her unawares,deep in thoughts. "Be the change you ever wish to see in the world,for it begins with you." is her mantra and looks forward to being the one she's ever wished to.</p>
